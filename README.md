# Electric Field Visualization Project

## Overview
This project is an interactive visualization of electric fields, showcasing the interaction between stationary and moving charges. It is implemented in Python, using libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib. The project aims to provide an intuitive understanding of fundamental concepts in electrostatics and electromagnetism through animated simulations.

## Features
- Visualization of electric fields generated by static and moving charges.
- Animation showing the dynamic changes in the field as a charge moves through it.
- Use of Coulomb's Law and the Superposition Principle to calculate electric fields.

## Physics and Math Principles
- **Coulomb's Law**: This law is the cornerstone of the simulation, used to calculate the electric field generated by point charges. The electric field \(\vec{E}\) due to a point charge \(q\) at a distance \(\vec{r}\) is simplified in the visualization for clarity.
- **Superposition Principle**: The total electric field is computed as the vector sum of the fields due to individual charges, illustrating the linear nature of electrostatics.
- **Electrostatics**: The focus is on electric charges at rest (static) and their interaction with moving charges, emphasizing the fundamental principles of electric forces.

## Technical Details
- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: NumPy for numerical calculations, Matplotlib for plotting and animations.
- **Animation**: Matplotlib's `FuncAnimation` class is used for creating dynamic visualizations of the electric field.

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python is installed along with NumPy and Matplotlib libraries.
2. Clone/download the repository.
3. Run the script `electric_field_visualization.py`.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporation of quantitative measurements.
- Extension to visualize magnetic fields and electromagnetic waves.
- Interactive features allowing users to place charges and observe resultant fields.
